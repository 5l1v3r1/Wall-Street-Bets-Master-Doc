## Basics

https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/

As society’s expectations change, banks must be transparent and clear about how their products and services create value for their customers, clients, investors, as well as society. The Principles for Responsible Banking help any bank – whatever its starting point – to align its business strategy with society’s goals.

The Principles provide the framework for a sustainable banking system, and help the industry to demonstrate how it makes a positive contribution to society.

They are accelerating the banking industry’s contribution to achieving society’s goals as expressed in the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement.

The Principles for Responsible Banking were launched by 130 banks from 49 countries, representing more than USD47 trillion in assets.

## Commentary

Basically the banks agreed to not take part in certain business activities, like:

> Paris-based BNP Paribas said in March that it would be **pulling 1 billion euros out of coal stocks**. London-based HSBC said last year that it **no longer lends to the coal industry or its customers**.

> Major financial institutions such as Barclays, SunTrust, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have announced **they will stop financing operators of private prisons** amid an increase in activity along the U.S.'s southern border that has put a spotlight on immigrant detention centers and the banks that finance them.

> Banks have also shifted their stance on lending to the shipping industry in an attempt to **cut carbon dioxide emissions**. In June, 11 banks that lend to shipping lines said they will integrate climate impact into the criteria that determines how much a shipping company can borrow, according to CNBC.
