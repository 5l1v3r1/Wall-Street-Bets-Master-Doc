# Overview:
Bank of India (also called State Bank of India) is the largest bank in India. Founded in 1906, nationalized since 1969. For anyone else who’s not sure what that is, nationalization means that the government took control of the bank. The two main reasons for this (publicly, anyway) are generally to a) prevent too much consolidation and b) divert bank credit towards priority industries like agriculture.
It also means that Bank of India is heavily tied to the Indian government, and specifically the Royal Bank of India (RBI). This means that in order for Bank of India to fail, it has to be allowed to fail by the Royal Bank of India and the Indian government generally. It looks as though BOI is in a pretty precarious position and has been for a while, like a lot of Indian banks. However, it's size and connection to the RBI makes Bank of India a risky play in my book.

### Stress Tests:
In 2016, 2017, and 2018, India’s state-run banks reported much higher nonperforming assets (NPAs) than estimated by the central bank under even its “severe stress” conditions. This means that the actual levels of nonperforming assets were higher than even the RBI's most pessimistic estimates. While RBI reports that NPAs decreased to 9.3% in 2019 (from 10% overall the year before), [Bloomberg reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-27/central-bank-warns-of-reversal-in-india-s-bad-loan-clean-up) that this trend has reversed into 2020. Bad loans at shadow (unregulated) banks has also increased slightly since March.
RBI also reports that the risk of contagion has been reduced over the same period. Contagion, in this case, is one institutional collapse leading to many (not the coronavirus). This report conflicts with Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, who found the risk of contagion had increased (see sources below for more info on this). Another report from five days ago notes that [the recent nationalization of Yes Bank](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/yes-bank-failure-exposes-india-to-wider-credit-risk-nomura/articleshow/74523995.cms) could lead to a national collapse of riskier assets.

## News:
#### Yes Bank Failure Exposes India to Wider Credit Risk: Nomura
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/yes-bank-failure-exposes-india-to-wider-credit-risk-nomura/articleshow/74523995.cms\
>Even as the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) try to put together a rescue arrangement for YES BankNSE 31.58 %, global investment firm Nomura has warned that these repeated relief measures are symptomatic of wider credit risks that still lurk in India’s financial system.

>“We expect weak growth and lagged effects of tight credit conditions to adversely impact asset quality of both shadow banks and the banking sector in the coming quarters,” Nomura said in a report released on Saturday.

#### Central Bank Warns of Reversal in India's Bad Loan Clean-Up
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-27/central-bank-warns-of-reversal-in-india-s-bad-loan-clean-up
>In its latest Financial Stability Report released Friday, the Reserve Bank of India said soured debt at Indian lenders will rise to 9.9% of total credit by September 2020, after dropping the most in 15 years to 9.3% a year earlier. It had previously forecast 9% in March.

>The authority, however, said the risk of contagion has eased from March, a time when any failure among the largest of the non-bank finance firms could have caused losses comparable to a collapse among the major banks.

>The RBI’s assessment contrasts with warnings from Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, which see rising risks of contagion in the Indian financial sector amid a persisting cash crunch. The credit quality of Indian companies has plummeted to a record as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government struggles to revive economic growth from a six-year-low.

#### View: Want Real Stress? Try Bad Loans in India at 20%
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/view-want-real-stress-try-bad-loans-in-india-at-20/articleshow/64762666.cms?from=mdr
>In June 2015, 2016 and 2017, the baseline estimates of distress RBI gave in its stress tests were on average 3 percentage points lower than the actual NPAs of government-controlled lenders nine months later. In fact, the outcomes were around 2 percentage points worse than what the central bank saw when it asked its crystal ball about a “severe stress” scenario.

>To make an allowance for the RBI’s optimism, you should add 3 percentage points to its baseline NPA projection of 16.3 percent. In other words, almost a fifth of Indian state-run banks’ assets might have soured by March next year.
