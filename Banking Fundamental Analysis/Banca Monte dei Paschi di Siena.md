## Overview

Tracing its history to a mount of piety founded in 1472 (548 years ago) and founded in its present form in 1624 (396 years ago), it is the world's oldest or second oldest bank, depending on the definition, and the fourth largest Italian commercial and retail bank.

### Monte Paschi CEO Won’t Seek New Term After April Meeting (Feb 20 2020)

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-20/monte-paschi-ceo-morelli-won-t-seek-new-term-after-april-agm

> Banca Monte Dei Paschi di Siena SpA Chief Executive Officer Marco Morelli will not seek a new term, leaving the bank without a leader just as it tries to find an exit from state control.

> His decision to leave comes amid uncertainty over two major decisions that are key to the bank’s future. In December, the European Commission and the Finance Ministry agreed to postpone the presentation of a plan for the state to sell off its 68% stake in the bank “in line with the ongoing discussion regarding a bank de-risking operation.”

> At the same time, the state is seeking to transfer as much as 10 billion euros ($10.8 billion) of bad loans to state-backed debt manager AMCO, with approval by the European Union expected by the end of February, daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported. The move would make Monte Paschi more attractive in a takeover or merger by significantly lowering its cost of risk.
