## Banking FA

Hey, I'm **Cannabiz_420** aka *Ti-84*. I'll be your Team Lead for the FA/Banking group. 

**Members:**
valkn0t, adwydman

**Purpose:**
Find banks exposed to foreign investments and go over their balance sheets/fundamentals to find potential picks for the TA team. 

Specifically looking for banks experiencing liquidity issues. 

**Criteria:**
Stress tests
Capital holdings (Equity and Debt, if possible)
Income to debt ratios
Minimum requirements for collateral - either base requirements by policy **OR** if you are able to find the actual holdings, the riskiest and the safest holding(s) they have.

**Timeline:**
*Tuesday, March 10th, 2020 End of Day (11:59pm EST):*
I wanna be able to at least breakdown the balance sheets. *Let me know if that's no possible and I'll help you work on that.* 
*Friday, March 13th, 2020 End of Day (11:59pm EST):*
Try to be done with the Top 3 Italian banks' analysis.
*Saturday, March 14th, 2020 End of Day (11:59pm EST):*
Will try to have empirical data summarized into readable format. 

*Future notes:*
We can also examine performance during 2008, how they've held up during recent recessions, and how the housing market has affected them, but that's further down the line. (Italy)
