## Overview

When lending money banks engage in activities bearing some levels of risk. Basel III is an international regulation signed by banks to mitigate the risk as much as possible. It was introduced as the reponse to the financial crisis of 2007-2008

### Required capital

The risk isn't equal for all of those loans, that's why the loans are weighted in order to calculate the total amount of **risk-weighted assets**.

Let's use $200,000,000,000 (200B) of loans given by Bank A as a starting point. Some are weighted at 100%, some at 50%, some at less than 50%, totaling in $100,000,000,000 (100B) in risk-weighted assets.

Basel III compells banks to set aside a certain percentage of risk-weighted assets. 

### Fewer balance sheet activities

Basel III puts a limit to the growing size of banks' balance sheets by putting a limit to the acitivites bank can perform compred to their own capital (**leverage ratio**).

### Sufficient liquidity

Every day a bank disposes of a certain level of cash, through it's activity of collecting deposits and by providing cash to clients while granting loans. It's likely that a bank will not be at equilibirum at the end of the day. 

If it has more deposits than loans, it will likely give a loan to another bank at the repo market. If it has granted more loans than received deposits, it will take a loan from another bank.

It is key for the bank to have equilibrium between it's loans and deposits over a certain period of time.

Basel III compells banks to have sufficient liquidity available over a period of 30 days (**Liquidity Coverage Ratio**).
