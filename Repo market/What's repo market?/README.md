## Repo market

Repo market has a turnover of $1-2T a day and it's a huge part of the financial system and isn't something you would think about until it stops working properly.

### What's repo?

Repurchase agreement (repo) is a form of short-term borrowing (often overnight) where two parties agree to the sale and future repurchase of a security.

Example:
John wants to borrow $400 from Tim. Tim says fine, but wants $404 back in 48 hours (1% interest). In addition John has to give Tim his new PS4 in case John isn't able to repay his loan.

So Tim is buying John's PS4 for $400, and in 48 hours John repurchases the PS4 for $404.

$404 - $400 = $4 - that's the repo rate, which is 1%.

Only banks and financial institutions take part in the repo market. Lenders are usually:
