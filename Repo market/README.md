### What's Repo?

Repurchase agreement (repo) is a form of short-term borrowing (often overnight) where two parties agree to the sale and future repurchase of a security.

The Repo market plays a huge part in the american financial system (Turnover rate of $1-2T per day), and it is not something one would think about until it stops working properly.  

Example:
John wants to borrow $400 from Tim. Tim says alright, but he wants $404 back in 48 hours (1% interest). In addition to the 1% interest rate, John agrees to give Tim his new PS4 (as collateral) in case John is not able to repay his loan.

So Tim is buying John's PS4 for $400, and in 48 hours John repurchases the PS4 for $404.

$404 - $400 = $4
The $4 is the repo rate, which is 1%.

### September 2019 repo rates blowup

Repo market isn't a volitile one, the rates (interest on the loans) are usually around 1-2%. However in the middle of September 2019 the repo rates shot up from 2% to 10% within a week:

The reason for the surge is simple: the lenders suddenly decided no to lend the money (because of liquidity issues), so the supply was decreased, while the demand for the money increased.

The fed explained that the supply was cut down because of two reasons:

1. Corporate Tax Payments drained the repo market of liquidity
2. The repo market was used to finance an unusually large Settlement of Treasure Debt Auctions

However [Bank for International Settlements](https://www.bis.org/) in their document [September stress in dollar repo markets: passing or structural?](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1912v.htm) stated that the above reasons may have contributed to the spike in repo rates. They focused on other more alarming reasons:

US repo markets currently rely heavily on four banks as marginal lenders:

1. J.P. Morgan
2. Bank of America
3. Citi Group
4. Wells Frago

If these banks even slightly reduce their lending, the market will suffer massively. However these banks have their own commercial interests, they can't be as relied on as a central bank.

On top of that, since 2008 banks have to satisfy liquidy regulations, such as **Liqudity Coverage Ratio (LCR)** (a part of the [Basel III](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm) that requires them to hold a certain amount of reserves. Meaning that even though a bank has the reserves, they can't lend it out to the repo market to satisfy the regulation.
