### What's repo?

Repo market has a turnover of $1-2T a day and it's a huge part of the financial system and isn't something you would think about until it stops working properly.

Repurchase agreement (repo) is a form of short-term borrowing (often overnight) where two parties agree to the sale and future repurchase of a security.

Example:
John wants to borrow $400 from Tim. Tim says alright, but he wants $404 back in 48 hours (1% interest). In addition to the 1% interest rate, John agrees to give Tim his new PS4 (as collateral) in case John is not able to repay his loan.

So Tim is buying John's PS4 for $400, and in 48 hours John repurchases the PS4 for $404.

$404 - $400 = $4
The $4 is the repo rate, which is 1%.

## Account Rules for Repo Markets

On June 12, 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued [Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures. (see page 34)](https://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1176164126488&acceptedDisclaimer=true)

These rules should be used when analyzing a companies balance sheet to determine it's exposure to the repo market.

### September 2019 repo rates blowup

The Repo market typically isn't volitile. The repo rates (interest on the loans) typically sit around 1-2%. However, in September 2019 repo rates shot up from 2% to 10% over the course of a week:

The cause of the surge was simple: lenders chose not to lend money (due to liquidity issues) to the repo, which led to a decrease in supply of money, while the demand for money increased.

The fed explained that the supply was cut down because of two reasons:

1. Corporate Tax Payments drained the repo market of liquidity and
2. The repo market was used to finance an unusually large Settlement of Treasure Debt Auctions

However, the [Bank for International Settlements](https://www.bis.org/) in a publication, [September stress in dollar repo markets: passing or structural?](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1912v.htm) stated that the above reasons may have merely contributed to the spike in repo rates. However, they focused on more alarming reasons:

The US repo markets heavily rely on four banks as marginal lenders:

1. J.P. Morgan (NYSE: $JPM)
2. Bank of America (NYSE: $BAC)
3. Citi Group (NYSE: $C)
4. Wells Frago (NYSE: $WFC)

If these banks even marginally reduced their lending, the market could suffer devestating outcomes. However, these banks have their own commercial interests and cannot be as relied on as a central bank.

Additionally, since 2008, banks have to satisfy liquidy regulations, such as the **Liqudity Coverage Ratio (LCR)** (a part of the [Basel III](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm) that requires banks to hold a certain amount of reserves. This means that even if a bank has the reserves, they can't lend it out to the repo market to satisfy the regulation.
