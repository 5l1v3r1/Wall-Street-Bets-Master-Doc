### What's Repo?

Repurchase agreement (repo) is a form of short-term borrowing (often overnight) where two parties agree to the sale and future repurchase of a security.

The Repo market plays a huge part in the american financial system (Turnover rate of $1-2T per day), and it is not something one would think about until it stops working properly.  

Example:
John wants to borrow $400 from Tim. Tim says alright, but he wants $404 back in 48 hours (1% interest). In addition to the 1% interest rate, John agrees to give Tim his new PS4 (as collateral) in case John is not able to repay his loan.

So Tim is buying John's PS4 for $400, and in 48 hours John repurchases the PS4 for $404.

$404 - $400 = $4
The $4 is the repo rate, which is 1%.
