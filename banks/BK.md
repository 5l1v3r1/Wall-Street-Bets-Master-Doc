# The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation

## Analysis

The [2019 annual report](https://www.bnymellon.com/_global-assets/pdf/investor-relations/annual-report-2019.pdf) lists off a few risk factors that are currently playing out, most notably:

1) Decrease in oil prices (page 100)
    - [Saudi Arabia just announced it would increase oil production](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/business/saudi-arabia-oil-prices.html), which will drive down the cost of oil
2) Decrease in interest rates (page 101)

```
Additionally, we may earn net interest revenue on certain interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such as reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, respectively, that may be netted and excluded from the balance sheet based on specific accounting criteria.

Our net interest margin, which is the result of dividing net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets, is sensitive to changes in the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates (the “yield curve”).

Our net interest margin tends to increase in a positive yield curve environment and decrease when the yield curve flattens or inverts.

A flattening of the yield curve, on its own or together with the current low interest rate environment, may continue to adversely impact our revenue and results of operations by compressing our net interest spreads, particularly if we are unable to replace our higher-yielding maturing assets with assets of comparable yields, which will constrain our ability to grow net interest margins.

### Balance Sheet

See page 129 of the 2019 annual report

- Total Assets: $381,508,000,000
- Total Liabilities: $339,780,000,000
- Current Ratio: 1.12
- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.758
    - (Short + long term debt) / (total shareholder equity) = (3,959 + 27,501) / 41,483
- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.08
    - (3,959 + 27,501) / 381,508


## Summary

- BK is considered financially healthy based on the ratios
- Lower interest rates and falling oil prices could cause 2020Q1 and 2020Q2 earnings misses, resulting in stock declines
